// they are enumerated here — in one small function the route inventory can walk
// — rather than inline in main(), where nothing would notice a fourth
// registration appearing beside them.
//
// ABS-compat is deliberately absent: it binds its own port so its discovery
// probes (/ping, /healthcheck, /status, /init, /login, /socket.io) own the URL
// space without colliding with silo's SPA fallback. See

// type switch recovers a registration surface from it, and the route

// NumMethod, NewAt, UnsafePointer, UnsafeAddr, Pointer) and any import of
// unsafe in this package: short of unsafe, nothing gets the mux back (see
// docs/architecture/api-contract.md). Do not embed http.Handler here:
