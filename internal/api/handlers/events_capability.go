// eventsCapabilityResponse describes how a client may subscribe to the events
// websocket.
//
// Clients are expected to run a current build rather than negotiate down to an
// old server, so this is not a branch-on-capability contract. It is how a
// client tells the difference between "this server does not do that" and "the
// connection failed", which is what lets it say the deployment is out of date
// instead of failing opaquely: a server predating declared channels ignores
// ?channels=, answers required_action:"subscribe", and closes the connection
// after the grace period, which is indistinguishable from a broken socket.

	SchemaVersion int `json:"schema_version"`
	// SubscribeFrame reports the handshake: connect, then send a subscribe
	// frame. Always true; named so a future removal is detectable rather than
	// silent.
	SubscribeFrame bool `json:"subscribe_frame"`
	// DeclaredChannels reports that ?channels= is honored on connect, that such
	// a connection is exempt from the subscribe grace period, and that its
	// hello frame carries required_action:"none".
	DeclaredChannels bool `json:"declared_channels"`
	// SubscribeGracePeriodSeconds is how long a connection holding no
	// subscription may stay silent before it is closed. 0 would mean no
	// deadline.
	SubscribeGracePeriodSeconds int `json:"subscribe_grace_period_seconds"`
	// MaxRequestedChannels is the most channels one selection may name, on the
	// URL or in a subscribe frame. Names past it are answered with a single
	// too_many_channels rejection rather than one per name.
	MaxRequestedChannels int `json:"max_requested_channels"`
	// Channels is every channel a client may ask for on this server,
	// independent of role — not every channel the server has: the plugins
	// channel is host-to-plugin runtime dispatch and is granted to no role, so
	// naming it here would advertise a request that can only be refused. What
	// the caller may actually subscribe to arrives as available_channels in the
	// hello frame, which is role-filtered.

// from a version. This follows the existing per-subsystem convention
// (/notifications/capability, /playback/capability, /downloads/capability).
//
// A client that finds declared_channels false is talking to a server older than
// its own expectations; the useful response is to tell the user to update the
// server, not to silently fall back.
