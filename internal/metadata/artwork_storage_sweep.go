// The artwork revision GC only ever sees revisions that were enqueued into
// artwork_revision_gc_candidates. A superseded revision that was never enqueued
// -- because the row was lost, the enqueue failed, or the displacement predates
// the queue -- is invisible to it forever, and nothing else in the server reads
// the bucket back. That is a one-way leak: the objects stay until someone
// deletes them by hand.
//
// This sweep closes it from the other side. It walks the bucket and deletes
// objects the catalog does not reference, which makes it a backstop for the GC
// rather than a replacement: the GC still collects promptly on displacement,
// and this catches whatever the GC never learned about.
