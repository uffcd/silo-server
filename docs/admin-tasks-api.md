# Administrator tasks and jobs

The v2 administrator task surface uses generated web bindings. Apple and Android
have no task or administrator-job HTTP calls in their checked source trees; the
migration inventory also records only web consumers. Jellyfin compatibility has
no equivalent management surface. Legacy routes remain available during migration.

## Execution and schedules

`GET /api/v2/admin/tasks` returns the finite registered task list in `items`.
`GET /api/v2/admin/tasks/{key}` reads runtime state on the responding process.
Both require acting-administrator access, as do task mutations and history.

`POST /api/v2/admin/tasks/{key}/run` reserves the local worker before returning
HTTP 200 with `execution_scope: "process"`. It starts execution asynchronously,
but does not create a durable job or promise execution after a process failure.
Concurrent local starts conflict. Another server has its own worker state.
`POST /api/v2/admin/tasks/{key}/cancel` requests cancellation of the current local
execution; completed effects remain. Neither operation automatically retries.

`GET /api/v2/admin/tasks/{key}/triggers` reads persisted schedule configuration
and a strong caller-bound ETag. `PUT` on that resource requires `If-Match` and a
`triggers` array, including an empty array to disable scheduling. The database
compares the original revision under the schedule parent lock. Legacy writers
use that same lock and advance the revision. A mismatch returns 412 with the
observed validator, without rereading or retrying the write. An empty schedule
remains configured across restarts rather than restoring task defaults.

Successful edits apply to the responding process. Other running processes load
the persisted configuration when they restart. Runtime state and persisted
schedule state are separate reads. The web editor captures the persisted schedule
when editing begins, keeps the draft and original validator after conflicts, and
requires explicit review and revision adoption before another submission. It
disables both mutation retries and authentication-refresh replay. The inherited
`max_runtime_ms` setting is stored but is not enforced by the task runner; the
editor labels that limitation rather than promising a timeout.

## History and metrics

`GET /api/v2/admin/tasks/{key}/history` returns persisted executions in an `items`
envelope with explicit `page` state. The default limit is 20 and maximum 200.
Database reads fetch at most limit plus one rows ordered by completed time and
ID descending. Signed cursors bind the task, account, acting profile, and order.
New completions appear after restarting history; loaded pages do not silently
expand into a whole-history read. Live last-execution summaries have no saved ID;
persisted history entries have opaque string IDs.

`GET /api/v2/admin/tasks/refresh_metadata/metrics` returns typed queue counters
and at most ten entries per sample list. Other tasks return 404. Raw diagnostic
errors are replaced with safe failure summaries. Task history does not expose
arbitrary internal result JSON; marker contribution counts have a typed result.
Detailed operational diagnostics remain available through their existing surface.

## Retained jobs

`GET /api/v2/admin/jobs` lists retained jobs with an optional `kind` filter,
default limit 20, maximum 200, and signed `(requested_at, id)` cursor ordering.
The database fetches at most limit plus one rows. Cursors bind the filter,
account, acting profile, and operation. The web exposes explicit continuation
and restart controls for job histories.

`GET /api/v2/admin/jobs/{id}` returns a safe typed job projection. Administrators
may read all retained jobs; other accounts may read only their own item-refresh
job. Hidden and missing jobs both return 404. Nonterminal responses supply
`Retry-After: 5`. The projection keeps library identities, typed result counts,
and authorized catalog artifact links, while excluding raw request documents,
storage keys, file paths, and internal error text. Artifact links can expire and
should be refreshed from the job resource.

The existing `POST /api/v2/library-jobs/{job_id}/cancel` contract remains intact.
The administrator task section does not add a generic durable scheduler or change
the retention and dispatch guarantees of existing job owners.
