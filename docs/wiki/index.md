# Silo Wiki

This directory is the repo-local home for user-digestible Silo documentation. Pages here
should stay portable Markdown so they can render cleanly in GitHub and sync into Wiki.js without
rewriting.

## Sections

## Getting Started

- No pages yet.

## Features

- No pages yet.

## Admin

- [Supported Media Folder Structures and Naming](admin/media-folder-and-naming.md) - Accurate
  reference for the folder layouts and filenames Silo can scan and match today.
- [Collection Templates](admin/collection-templates.md) - Curated, one-click starting points for
  synced library collections sourced from TMDB, Trakt, and MDBList.
- [Local NFO Metadata](admin/nfo-local-metadata.md) - Supported NFO sidecar fields, how they merge
  with online providers, and the naming-supplies-structure contract.
- [Monitoring Stream Nodes](admin/monitoring-nodes.md) - Reading the Nodes page columns, re-probing
  a node's GPU after a driver change, scratch-disk admission, and scraping node metrics.

## Deployment

- [Deploy Silo with Docker](deployment/docker.md) - Install and operate Silo with Docker Compose,
  including storage, GPU acceleration, search, distributed roles, tuning, backups, and updates.

## Troubleshooting

- No pages yet.

## Editing Rules

- Keep pages in `docs/wiki/` digestible for the intended audience.
- Prefer updating existing pages over creating duplicates.
- Use YAML frontmatter and portable Markdown.
- Add `## Source References` sections instead of copying code into docs.
- Reserve `docs/wiki/` for end-user and operator docs. Keep architecture material in
  `docs/architecture/`.
- When a page is added, replace the matching `No pages yet.` line with bullet entries in this form:
  `- [Page Title](section/file.md) - one-line summary`
- When a section already has pages, append a new bullet instead of adding prose.
