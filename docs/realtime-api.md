# Realtime API

`GET /api/v2/events/capabilities` describes the shared event subscription
protocol. It requires an authenticated account; no active profile is required.
When the event service is unavailable, the capability response remains `200` with `state: not_configured` and `allowed: false`.

The response contains `schema_version`, `subscribe_frame`, `declared_channels`,
`subscribe_grace_period_seconds`, `max_requested_channels`, and `channels`.
These values come from the same implementation as the bridge capability route
and the event socket's enforced subscription limits. `channels` lists client
channels independently of the caller's role. The socket hello frame determines
which channels that connection may actually subscribe to. Internal plugin
channels are excluded.

This read creates no ticket or connection and does not grant access to a
channel. It describes the subscription protocol, not a socket authentication
credential or a guarantee that a particular API-version socket is available.
Socket authorization and ticket issuance are separate contracts. The bridge
capability response remains unchanged. Current first-party web, Apple, and
Android callers do not consume this capability read; Jellyfin has no matching
native realtime discovery operation.

## Session-bound socket handshake

`POST /api/v2/events/ws-ticket` delegates a current access-token login session
for one connection. API keys and credentials without a bounded access-token
expiry cannot mint this proof. A profile is optional; when present, its ownership
and PIN proof must validate. The ticket is opaque, expires within 30 seconds,
and binds the account, login session, account role, profile proof and resolved
access policy. The response includes `ticket`, `expires_in`,
`max_connection_seconds` (300), and `protocol` (`silo.events.v2`). It is not cached.
Minting is naturally idempotent in effect: extra credentials are harmless
orphans that expire, so shared session refresh may retry the mint. A consumed
credential is never reused for reconnects.

Connect to `GET /api/v2/events/ws` with exactly these offered subprotocols,
in order: `silo.events.v2`, `silo.ticket.<ticket>`. The server selects only
`silo.events.v2`, never the credential-bearing entry. Neither bearer tokens nor
tickets belong in the URL. Only the `channels` query selection is needed for
clients using declared subscriptions. Request bodies are refused. An Origin,
when present, must equal the configured public origin; without that setting it
must match the request scheme and host. Forwarded host headers grant no Origin
exception. Native clients may omit Origin but need the same session proof.
Malformed upgrades and rejected origins do not consume valid tickets.

Consumption is atomic through Redis `GETDEL`. A Redis failure fails closed.
Without Redis, tickets are process-local and require affinity to the minting
node; restarting that node invalidates them. This store is distinct from the
bridge's user/profile-only ticket, which cannot authenticate a v2 connection.

Admission rechecks the current session, enabled account, account role and viewer
policy/PIN proof. Secondary profiles do not receive administrator channels.
Connections end at access-token expiry or after five minutes, whichever comes
first. Current session/account/profile policy is rechecked every 15 seconds;
a failed check closes the connection, with a two-second bound on authority
lookups. Clients must reconnect with a newly minted credential. This is bounded
revocation detection, not an instantaneous revocation guarantee.

The selected message protocol retains the existing event frames (`hello`,
`subscribe`, `subscribed`, `snapshot`, `event`, `error`) and per-channel payloads.
The shared event implementation still applies channel eligibility, the subscribe
grace period, inbound frame limits, snapshots, ping/pong and delivery filtering.
The handshake version does not rewrite another domain's event payload.
Web consumers capture account/profile authority before minting and discard
connection results and frames after that authority changes.

Native socket/ticket adoption and independent domain review are required before
these two migration rows can be ratified. No bridge socket or ticket was removed.

### Owner-bound playback control handshake (v2)

`POST /api/v2/playback/sessions/{session_id}/control/ws-ticket`
(`createPlaybackControlSocketTicket`) delegates the caller's current access-token
login session and verified profile proof to one control handshake for one
playback session. The body's `installation_id` is optional: send the value
`getPlaybackCapabilities` returned, and it must equal this server's installation;
omit it for a session the bridge started. Minting checks, in order: a bounded
login session; the current session, enabled account, role and viewer/PIN proof;
that the playback session exists in the session manager and belongs to the
caller's account and profile (`403 permission_denied` otherwise); and that a
presented `installation_id` matches the server's (`409 conflict`). A lane
already held by a different account, profile or installation is also `409`. The
response carries `ticket`, `expires_in` (at most 30 seconds),
`max_connection_seconds` (14400) and `protocol` (`silo.playback-control.v2`).
It is not cached. Minting is naturally idempotent in effect: extra credentials
expire unused.

Connect to `GET /api/v2/playback/sessions/{session_id}/control/ws`
(`connectPlaybackControlSocket`) offering exactly `silo.playback-control.v2`
then `silo.ticket.<ticket>`; the server selects only the protocol. Neither
bearer tokens nor tickets belong in the URL, request bodies are refused, and an
Origin, when present, must equal the configured public origin. Malformed
upgrades and rejected origins do not consume the credential. At upgrade the
credential is consumed atomically (Redis `GETDEL`; process-local without
Redis), login authority is re-validated, and ownership and installation are
re-admitted against the credential's captured binding: a binding that moved
since minting is `409` and the credential is spent. A credential presented for
another session is `403`; an ended session is `404`.

The connection is the session's single realtime lane. A reconnect resumes the
lane only for the same account, profile and installation: it takes the lane
over and the superseded connection is closed, so its later ack and result
frames are never routed. Ack and result frames are applied only while the
receiving registration still owns the lane, through the existing command
tracker and stop-completion paths. Login authority and session ownership are
re-checked every 15 seconds and the connection ends when either is lost, at
access-token expiry, or after four hours. The frames (`hello`, command, `ack`,
`result`, event) are unchanged from the bridge socket.

`GET /api/v2/playback/sessions/control/capabilities` reports `available`, plus
`protocol` only when this server serves the handshake. The web player mints
under captured profile authority for every connection, offers the protocol pair,
discards frames once that authority changes, and uses the bridge socket only
when the handshake is not served (`404`/`503`), never after an ownership
refusal. The bridge socket route is
unchanged.


### V2 suggestion reads and vote membership

`GET /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/suggestions` requires login/profile
credentials and the matching signed room access token in `X-Room-Token`. The room
proof binds the room, account and profile; it does not replace login authority.
The response is `{items, page}` with string identifiers and UTC timestamps.
`limit` and opaque `cursor` bound a live traversal ordered by creation time then
suggestion ID. Cursor scope includes account, profile, access policy, room and
page size. Vote changes do not move suggestions across the cursor. Concurrent
creation/deletion is not a snapshot; clients refresh to reconcile live changes.
Room lifecycle and the room websocket still use the bridge contract.

`POST` and `DELETE` on
`/api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/suggestions/{suggestion_id}/vote` use the same
authority and return bodyless `204` for the requested vote membership, including
an already satisfied state. Repository membership and tally changes remain one
transaction. Existing no-op handling precedes list reads and broadcasts; actual
changes retain the existing room broadcast path. Opposing votes have no generation
ordering. A closed room returns `409`; a missing room or suggestion returns `404`.
An error after a database commit does not prove that the vote was unchanged.

The web adapter drains bounded pages under one captured authority and sorts the
completed list by votes for display. After a vote receipt it reloads under that
same authority; it does not replay or retarget a mutation after authentication or
profile changes. Suggestion creation, deletion, promotion, room policy and room
socket migration are separate operations. Native consumer closure remains
required before ratifying these mappings.

`DELETE /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/suggestions/{suggestion_id}`
requires the same login/profile and `X-Room-Token` proof. Only the room host or
original suggester, matched by both account and profile, may delete the entry.
Success returns bodyless `204`. Missing suggestions, including repeated deletion,
return `404` before list reads or broadcasts. Current creation never reuses IDs,
so repeating deletion cannot address a replacement entry. The existing domain
service retains its deletion and broadcast path. A failure after deletion does
not establish that the entry still exists.

The existing web delete action sends once, surfaces errors including `404`, and
reloads the bounded list only after success under the original captured authority.
It does not replay after a lost response or authentication error. Suggestion
creation and promotion remain separate bridge operations.

### End a Watch Together room

`DELETE /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}` (`closeWatchTogetherRoom`) requires authenticated profile authority and the demo guard. The existing service checks both the host account and host profile. A guest room token does not authorize closing; this operation does not require room proof in addition to host identity.

Success returns bodyless `204` after the existing room-close service completes. Non-host authority returns `403`, a missing room `404`, an already-ended room `409`, and unavailable service `503`. Natural-idempotent classification describes convergence on ended state, not a promise that every repeated request returns `204`. The actual web action sends once without authentication replay and fences original authority before dispatch, after receipt and before completion feedback. It does not optimistically mark the room ended or automatically retry an uncertain close.

The owning service retains persistence, host/wait timer cleanup, local connected-member `room_closed` dispatch with the existing `host_left` reason, and live-room removal. This port changes no domain persistence or callback behavior. It does not cancel already-dispatched playback, establish cross-node socket broadcast, or complete the separate v2 room-socket contract. Existing room creation, joining and room credentials remain separate migration scopes; v1 wire behavior is unchanged.

### Read a Watch Together room

`GET /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}` (`getWatchTogetherRoom`) requires authenticated profile authority and existing room proof in `X-Room-Token`. It fails closed when the room/token service is unavailable. Proof must match the exact room, account and profile. Invalid proof returns `403`, missing room `404`, closed room `409`, and unavailable service `503`.

A successful no-store `200` returns `room` and renewed `room_access_token`. The snapshot preserves selection, playback anchor, host/member roles and permission fields. IDs are strings on v2; the anchor time is a typed UTC instant. Renewal retains the existing room/account/profile token semantics. This token is not a session-bound socket credential, does not grant account authentication, and does not complete the separate v2 room-socket contract.

The existing web initial-room read sends proof only in the header, captures authority before dispatch, rejects stale success and failure, validates identities before converting to the existing UI model, and fences publication against room-effect cancellation and authority replacement. Closed-room conflict is terminal. Existing room-proof storage and socket transport remain separate; the read does not activate a new native surface or migrate the room socket. Domain snapshot and v1 wire behavior are unchanged.

### Set guest transport policy

`PATCH /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/policy` (`updateWatchTogetherRoomPolicy`) requires authenticated profile authority, the demo guard and both the host account and profile. Its body contains `guest_control_policy`: `host_only` or `guest_play_pause`. This host action does not require guest room proof. Invalid policy returns `422`, non-host authority `403`, missing room `404`, closed room `409`, and unavailable service/token configuration `503`.

Success returns a no-store `200` room snapshot and renewed existing room proof. The owning service retains generation-based persistence and local snapshot broadcasts. If a competing writer wins the generation check, it can return the refreshed winning snapshot without retrying or broadcasting the failed write. Clients must use that returned policy rather than assuming the requested value was stored. Natural-idempotent classification describes the policy value; it does not promise an unchanged generation or suppress successful-write broadcasts.

The existing web toggle captures policy and authority, sends once without authentication replay, and fences authority, replaced room and superseded run before publication or feedback. It retains a newer currently held room generation when a policy response is older. Stale room/run failures do not report into the replacement context. It does not automatically read, rebase or retry a conflict/uncertain result. Existing proof renewal is not a session-bound socket credential. V1 service behavior, guest transport enforcement and socket protocol remain unchanged; no cross-node broadcast or native activation is implied.

### Resolve a room invitation

`POST /api/v2/watch-together/join` (`joinWatchTogetherRoom`) requires authenticated account/profile authority and the demo guard. Send `code` or `join_token` in the JSON body. Values are trimmed; a nonempty invite token takes precedence when both are supplied. Missing input returns `422`, missing room `404`, closed room `409`, and unavailable room/token service `503` before proof issuance.

Success returns a no-store `200` with the existing room snapshot and room/account/profile-bound `room_access_token`. HTTP joining resolves the invitation and issues proof; it does not connect a member, attach playback, or cancel the host-disconnect timer. Those effects belong to the separate socket lifecycle. Repeated resolution can issue a different proof and observe a newer room snapshot; natural-idempotent classification does not promise a stable credential or durable admission receipt. Existing v1 behavior is unchanged.

The actual web code-entry and invite auto-join/retry actions copy input and capture authority synchronously, send once without authentication replay, and suppress navigation and errors after authority replacement, unmount, superseding request or invite replacement. The existing room route still receives room proof for the legacy socket flow. This operation does not make that proof session-bound, migrate the socket, or activate dormant native UI. Room creation remains a separate operation.

### Select room content as the host

`PUT /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/selection` (`selectWatchTogetherRoomItem`) requires authenticated profile authority, the demo guard and both the host account and profile. The body requires `content_id`; optional `file_id` and `library_id` are positive string IDs. Host selection does not require guest room proof. The existing resolver retains playable-content and access checks. Vote rooms reject direct selection with `409`; non-host authority returns `403`, missing room `404`, invalid selection `422`, closed room `409`, and unavailable service/token configuration `503`.

A changed selection retains the existing service behavior: reset playback anchor to zero and paused, enter waiting with resume-on-ready, advance selection revision and generation, clear prior member playback-session/readiness/buffering/ignore-wait state, and broadcast the local snapshot. The v2 writer locks the authoritative database row and compares resolved content, file and library identity before any reset. An identical current selection preserves anchor, revision, generation, member readiness, waiting timer and broadcasts. This is a current-state no-op, not a historical replay receipt: after a different intervening selection, the old request can select its content again. The operation remains non-retryable. A competing generation writer can cause the service to return its refreshed winning snapshot without replaying the failed selection. Clients must use the returned snapshot.

The actual web action captures input and authority, sends once without authentication replay, and fences replaced authority, room and request run before publication. A newer held generation is retained only for the same room. Stale receipts do not clear the candidate or display completion feedback. There is no automatic read, rebase or retry after an uncertain result. Success returns the existing room snapshot and renewed room/account/profile proof; that proof is not a session-bound socket credential. The v1 selection writer retains its frozen reset behavior; all nodes serving this v2 operation must use the guarded writer. A no-op refresh from another node adopts a newer selection revision locally and discards readiness belonging to the prior selection. This port does not migrate the room socket, establish cross-node broadcast or activate dormant native UI.

### Suggestion creation receipt storage

The v2 suggestion creation prerequisite stores a caller-selected suggestion identity with the original account, profile, room and a SHA-256 digest of the canonical content metadata. The receipt and suggestion insert commit in one transaction. The room row is locked before admission, so committed closure refuses creation. An identical retry returns the existing suggestion; a different owner, room or payload conflicts. The created flag distinguishes insertion from replay so the later caller can avoid repeat broadcasts.

Receipts survive suggestion and room deletion. Repeating a deleted identity conflicts instead of recreating it. Receipts retain no title, note or poster URL payload and are removed on login-account deletion. There is no age-based receipt expiry; expiring them would permit identity reuse. Legacy suggestion insertion/deletion and their wire behavior are unchanged. The receipt store does not dispatch broadcasts or provide durable broadcast delivery; the caller behavior is described below.

### Create a room suggestion

`POST /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/suggestions` (`createWatchTogetherSuggestion`) requires authenticated profile authority, the demo guard and original room proof in `X-Room-Token`. Supply a client-generated UUID `suggestion_id`, required `content_id`, `content_type` (`movie` or `episode`) and `title`, plus optional `subtitle`, `poster_url` and `note`. The receipt migration must be installed before enabling this writer on any v2-serving node.

A successful insertion or identical live replay returns `201` with `suggestion_id`. The original account/profile/room and metadata are bound by the receipt store. Changed or deleted identities return `409` without resurrection; closed room returns `409`, missing room `404`, invalid input `422`, invalid proof `403`, and unavailable service `503`. Current suggestion state is read separately. The service supplies creation time and attempts the existing local suggestion snapshot broadcast only for a new insertion. A failure after commit can leave the broadcast incomplete; retry returns the identity without attempting it again. This is not durable delivery or an outbox.

The actual web candidate holds an immutable ID, metadata, room proof and authority. Explicit retry of that unchanged draft reuses them; dismissing or replacing it creates a new identity. Authority replacement refuses the old draft instead of rebinding it. Each submission sends one POST without authentication replay and refreshes the existing suggestion list under the original authority after a matching receipt. Superseded room/run/authority cannot publish the list; superseded candidate cannot be cleared or receive success/error feedback. Drafts are not persisted across page reloads. Room proof expiry is surfaced without automatic renewal or rebasing. V1 creation remains unchanged; native caller inventory and adoption are separate gates.

### Promote a room suggestion

`POST /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/suggestions/promote` (`promoteWatchTogetherSuggestion`) requires profile/demo authority, original `X-Room-Token`, both host account and profile, and a suggestion belonging to the room. The body contains `suggestion_id`. A vote room requires a nonzero tally and its current winner. The existing tally read precedes selection admission; a vote arriving between them does not retroactively invalidate the host action. This is not a serializable vote freeze.

The v2 path retains playable/access resolution, then uses the guarded selection transaction. Promotion chooses content rather than an explicit file variant: already-selected content preserves its selected file/library, playback anchor, revision/generation, attached readiness and local broadcast count even if the resolver now prefers another variant. A different eligible content selection resets playback/readiness once. Direct selection continues to compare all resolved identities. Host/closed/mode checks still precede the no-op. No historical replay receipt is promised after intervening different content, so promotion remains non-retryable. Frozen v1 promotion remains unchanged.

Success returns the authoritative room snapshot and renewed existing room proof. A competing writer may determine that snapshot; the web reports selection updated without asserting playback started. Missing room/suggestion returns `404`, non-host or invalid proof `403`, closed/no-votes/nonwinner `409`, unplayable selection `422`, and unavailable service `503`. The actual panel sends once without auth replay, suppresses stale room/run/authority success and error feedback, and compares generations only within one room before publication. No new session-bound socket proof, cross-node broadcast, native activation or real playback dispatch is established by this port.

### Room creation identity storage

The v2 room creation prerequisite binds a caller-selected room ID to its original host account, host profile and selection mode. Room and receipt insert atomically. The caller supplies server-generated code, invite token and initial room state; regenerated values on retry do not replace stored credentials or state. Exact replay returns the current active room, including later playback changes. A changed original host or mode conflicts. A closed room stays closed, and a deleted room cannot be recreated under its retained ID.

Creation receipts retain no invitation credentials and survive room deletion. They are removed with login-account deletion and have no age-based expiry. Collision with an existing unreceipted legacy room refuses adoption and rolls back the new receipt. The v1 creation service and insert remain unchanged. This storage prerequisite does not register a creation endpoint or hydrate live members; the later v2 service must preserve existing live-room membership on replay. Stable web draft identity, native coordination and rollout remain separate work.

### API v2 room creation

`POST /api/v2/watch-together/rooms` (`createWatchTogetherRoom`) requires an authenticated account, selected profile, and non-demo authority. The JSON body requires a caller-selected UUID `room_id` and `selection_mode` (`host_pick` or `vote`). The server generates the initial room code, invite token, and timestamps. The retained room-creation receipt migration must precede enabling this writer.

A successful insert or exact active replay returns `201` with the current room snapshot and account/profile room proof. Original account/profile/mode binding cannot change. Closed rooms and conflicting or deleted creation identities return `409`; invalid input returns `422`; an unavailable dependency returns `503`. Replay retains stored invite credentials and does not overwrite connected members, readiness, or playback state. The response includes local member information without creating membership or broadcasting creation. This proof is not a session-bound socket credential.

Only a definite room-code or invite-token uniqueness violation allows up to three internal credential candidates with the same caller identity and original binding. An uncertain database outcome is not retried internally. The response is current state, not a durable admission receipt, historical snapshot, outbox, or cross-node membership guarantee. Creation does not hydrate a local room; the existing socket/read paths handle loading separately. Frozen v1 creation is unchanged.

The web create action captures one immutable room UUID, selection mode, and profile authority. An explicit retry after uncertainty retains that draft; mode replacement creates another draft. Replaced authority is never rebound to an old draft. Stale completion cannot navigate or clear a newer pending action. No automatic authentication replay or draft persistence across page reload is provided. Native creation adoption and exact caller inventories remain separate acceptance gates.

### Room socket credential storage prerequisite

Room socket tickets use a separate shared Redis namespace and atomic consumption. There is no in-memory fallback: Redis availability is required for both mint and consume. A ticket binds the room ID, captured delegated login session/account/profile/PIN/scope authority, and original room-proof expiry. Its lifetime is at most 30 seconds and cannot exceed either access-token or room-proof expiry. Consumption burns a ticket even if the requested room mismatches. Events tickets and profile-only room proofs cannot substitute for this credential.

This storage foundation does not expose a socket or validate current account/session/profile authority. The room socket handler below validates that authority and room proof before minting and enforces the connection obligations separately. Storage availability alone does not prove socket admission or native adoption.


### API v2 room socket admission and lifetime

`POST /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/ws-ticket` (`createWatchTogetherSocketTicket`) requires authenticated profile/demo authority, an expiring access login session, and the original `X-Room-Token` matching room/account/profile. API keys and profile-only room proof cannot delegate a socket. The room proof must have a valid HS256 signature and signed expiry; frozen v1 proof validation is unchanged. Current session validity, enabled account/role, profile PIN verification, viewer scope, and room existence are checked before minting. The response carries `ticket`, `expires_in`, `max_connection_seconds` (300), and `protocol` (`silo.room.v2`). Credential storage failure returns 503; invalid original proof or authority returns 403; closed rooms return 409. No automatic room-proof renewal occurs here.

Connect with `GET /api/v2/watch-together/rooms/{room_id}/ws` (`connectWatchTogetherSocket`), offering exactly `silo.room.v2` and `silo.ticket.<ticket>` in that order. Only `silo.room.v2` is echoed. Request bodies and all query strings are refused, including legacy bearer/profile/PIN/room credentials. A supplied browser Origin must match the configured public origin; absent Origin is permitted for independently authenticated native callers. Forwarded headers do not authorize an Origin. Malformed upgrades are refused before consuming the credential. After consumption, current session/account/profile/PIN/scope and room existence are checked again before 101.

The handler closes the underlying socket at the earlier of five minutes, access expiry, or original room-proof expiry. Every 15 seconds it rechecks current authority and room existence with a two-second validation timeout; errors close the connection rather than extending its deadline. Revocation is therefore bounded by that polling interval and timeout, not instantaneous. Missing Redis prevents runtime socket wiring; Redis errors never use an in-memory fallback.

The post-upgrade loop is shared with frozen v1: Connect, Disconnect(false), initial snapshots, attach-session/transport/state-report/ready/buffering messages and ping/pong retain their existing behavior and frame shapes. There is no new leave message or global membership synchronization. V2 cancellation closes the transport so a blocked read releases and executes the existing disconnect callback. These raw frame shapes are not the typed HTTP room snapshot schema. No playback/provider operation is implied by obtaining a ticket.

The actual web room/player hook obtains a fresh credential for each reconnect. It captures original room proof and profile authority, sends no authentication retry, uses no URL credentials, checks the negotiated protocol, and suppresses old sockets' messages/results after authority or room replacement. It subscribes to the existing AuthProvider so same-profile PIN replacement rebinds even when room props do not change. A fresh reconnect uses an already-rotated access token only while the original logical authority remains current; it does not replay a refused ticket request. Terminal ticket refusals stop reconnecting; transient failures retain the existing bounded reconnect delay. Existing room-proof expiry ends access; it is not automatically renewed or rebound. Native adoption and exact caller inventories remain separate gates. Shared ticket consumption does not provide cross-node live room membership or broadcast coordination.
