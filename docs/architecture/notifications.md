# Notifications

Silo's user-facing notification system treats media availability as durable,
server-side release events, fans them out to interested profiles as inbox
rows, and accelerates delivery through realtime websocket, web push, and
outbound webhooks. The durable `notification_deliveries` row is always the
source of truth; every other channel is best-effort on top of it. The code
lives in `internal/notifications` (distinct from the operational catalog/jobs
`Hub` in the same package).

## Release types

A release event records that an item became newly available in a library —
not that metadata says it aired, and not that the notifications feature first
saw it. Availability is a one-way fact: file churn (quality upgrades,
re-downloads) does not re-notify, and libraries emit no events until their
initial availability seeding completes.

Event kinds:

- `episode` — carries series/episode identity and fans out to interested
  profiles. An unset kind is normalized to `episode` (the column defaults to
  it; only in-memory events can be empty).
- Flat item kinds (`movie`, `audiobook`, `ebook`) — carry an item ID only and
  feed the server-channel broadcast feed; they do not fan out per profile.

Events can be suppressed instead of fanned out, with the reason recorded on
the row: `series_burst` when the per-series burst cap consumed the event
(bulk imports fan out only the highest few episode keys per series per
batch), or `stale` when the event aged past the fanout staleness horizon
(extended downtime, fanout disabled for a stretch) — delivering it long after
the fact would be noise.

The delivery `type` registry (`episode.available`, `webhook.auto_disabled`,
`request.*`, …) is extensible by construction; clients must render unknown
types with a generic fallback.

## Eligibility rules

Fanout evaluates each candidate `(profile, series)` interest row against the
release event's episode key:

- `favorite`, `watchlist`, and `continue_watching` notify on any newly
  available episode of the series.
- `next_up` notifies only when the episode is at or beyond the profile's
  `next_expected_episode_key`.
- Suppress when `last_notified_episode_key >= episode_key`.
- Profile-level notification preferences are a hard gate: a reason disabled
  in preferences can never match, so no delivery row is created and no
  channel — including webhooks — ever sees the event. Per-webhook reason
  filters can only narrow further, never re-enable.

Multiple matching reasons produce one delivery with merged reason flags.
Deliveries are deduplicated per `(profile, release event)` and, for
`episode.available`, per `(profile, episode)` across libraries, so
dual-quality library setups notify at most once. Reprocessing an event is
idempotent.

## Release-event retention

Release events and inbox deliveries have independent lifetimes. Pruning an old
release event clears `notification_deliveries.release_event_id` through its
`ON DELETE SET NULL` foreign key and retains the delivery. An `episode.available`
delivery still requires its `library_id`, `series_id` and `episode_id` snapshot;
its event reference is optional. Event pruning must not delete inbox rows or
relax those snapshot requirements.

The constraint repair preserves existing deliveries. Its rollback restores the
previous constraint only if every episode delivery still has an event reference;
otherwise PostgreSQL rejects the rollback atomically. It never deletes detached
inbox rows to make rollback possible.

## Request notifications

Request lifecycle deliveries (`request.fulfilled`, `request.approved`,
`request.declined`) are operational notices posted directly to the requesting
profile — no interest index, no fanout. Their `reason_flags` carry request
identifiers (request ID, TMDB ID, media type; approved/declined also carry
the title since no catalog item exists yet) rather than the four reason
booleans. Partial unique indexes per `(profile_id, request_id, type)` make
the inserts idempotent, and the per-webhook `notify_requests` flag gates the
webhook channel for them.

## Outbound webhooks

Each profile can register up to a capped number of webhook destinations
(Discord or generic), with per-webhook reason filters. The profile chose the
URL, so notification content — titles, season/episode numbers — is included;
the guardrails below are the ones the profile cannot opt out of.

### Trust model and SSRF guard

Webhook deliveries are direct outbound HTTP from the user's own server, so
the destination URL is attacker-controllable input against that server's
network position:

- HTTPS only; TLS verification is not user-overridable.
- The destination host must never resolve to a private or special-purpose
  address. The deny set covers the IPv4 private/special ranges (loopback,
  RFC 1918, link-local, CGNAT, TEST-NETs, benchmarking, multicast, reserved)
  and the IPv6 equivalents (unspecified, loopback, ULA, link-local,
  documentation, NAT64). IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are unwrapped before
  checking so `::ffff:127.0.0.1` cannot bypass the IPv4 entries.
- The guard runs at registration *and* at connect time (the dialer
  re-validates the resolved address) to defeat DNS rebinding. Redirects are
  bounded and each hop is re-checked.
- An admin-only `notifications.webhooks.allow_private_destinations` setting
  exists for development environments.

Webhook URLs and generic signing secrets are encrypted at rest, never
returned by the API after creation (only the host is readable — a Discord
webhook URL is itself a bearer credential), and redacted in logs.

### Server URL leakage

Webhook payloads must not reveal the user's server origin. Discord fetches
embed thumbnail URLs, and the raw payload is visible to channel members, so
an absolute self-hosted artwork URL discloses the server's address to
Discord's infrastructure and to everyone in the channel. The rules:

- Embed builders only ever emit public provider origins (themoviedb.org,
  imdb.com, thetvdb.com and their image CDNs) by default. Presigned
  server-storage URLs appear only under the admin's explicit "server" poster
  mode opt-in (`System.discordPosterURL`).
- Builders never derive artwork URLs themselves; they render the poster URL
  the sender layer resolved under that policy.
- Generic payloads carry no server URL, no absolute artwork URLs, and no
  library name.

### Discord payload

Discord webhooks receive a native embed (no `content` line), with
`username: "Silo"` and a per-reason accent color (favorite, watchlist,
continue-watching, next-up precedence order). The builder enforces Discord's
embed limits — 256-char title, 4096-char description, 1024-char field
values, 2048-char footer, 6000 chars total — truncating description first
and never the title. Embeds cannot ping: Discord only parses mentions from
the top-level `content` field, which this payload never sets (the
`allowed_mentions` field is omitted rather than sent).

### Generic payload and HMAC signing

Generic webhooks receive canonical Silo JSON: event name, delivery and
webhook IDs, timestamp, `version`, `test` flag, profile ID, delivery type,
reason flags, and the series/episode (or request) content blocks.

Each request is signed with the webhook's per-destination 32-byte secret:

- Headers: `X-Silo-Event`, `X-Silo-Webhook-Id`, `X-Silo-Delivery-Id`,
  `X-Silo-Timestamp` (Unix epoch seconds), and
  `X-Silo-Signature: t=<epoch>,v1=<hex-hmac-sha256>` (Stripe's convention,
  so existing verification libraries work).
- The HMAC-SHA256 input is `{X-Silo-Timestamp}.{request body bytes}` — the
  literal bytes Silo sends. Receivers verify against the literal bytes they
  received with a constant-time compare and a replay window (~5 minutes); no
  JSON canonicalization is required on either side.
- The secret is returned once at create/rotate time and is never readable
  afterward. Rotation takes effect immediately with no dual-acceptance
  window; retried attempts re-sign with the current secret.

### Retry schedule and auto-disable

Delivery attempts are durable outbox rows committed in the fanout
transaction, so a crash between commit and dispatch delays a webhook instead
of dropping it (a recovery sweep claims stale pending rows). Each attempt has
a 10-second total timeout. Failures retry on an exponential schedule of
cumulative delays since the first attempt:

immediate, 30s, 2m, 10m, 30m, 2h, 6h, 12h, 18h, 24h — ten attempts total,
then the webhook is auto-disabled.

Non-retryable 4xx responses (everything except 408, 425, and 429) are
deterministic destination-side rejections: the attempt fails immediately
without walking the schedule. Auto-disable on that path requires three
*consecutive* deliveries to fail with a non-retryable 4xx, because
destination-side WAF/CDN blips intermittently 4xx valid webhooks. 429 honors
`Retry-After` when present. Auto-disable posts a `webhook.auto_disabled`
notice to the profile's inbox — a type that is itself excluded from webhook
dispatch so a broken webhook cannot loop.
