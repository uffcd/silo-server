# Administrator accounts and access groups

The v2 administrator routes require an authenticated acting administrator and
retain the demo write guard. Scoped API keys retain their existing account and
access-group grants; they cannot impersonate accounts. A household primary
profile is not a server administrator.

`GET /api/v2/admin/users/capabilities` reports account management, guarded
configuration, transactional default-profile creation, and access-group support.
Unsupported services return a capability or dependency Problem Details response.
The existing paginated account list remains at `GET /api/v2/admin/users`.

## Account editor

`GET /api/v2/admin/users/{id}` returns the canonical account editor and an ETag.
The tag binds the acting account/profile, account revision, and inherited group
configuration revision. Conditional reads support `If-None-Match` and 304.

`PUT` and `DELETE` of that resource require `If-Match`: missing guards return 428;
stale guards return 412. The account revision check, configuration change, and
revocation of affected direct and impersonation login sessions commit in one
transaction. A failed write rolls back all three. Existing account writers also
advance the revision. After a successful update (204), fetch the canonical editor
again before editing further. Deletion returns 204.

Omitted update fields preserve their values. Nullable policy overrides accept
`null` to restore inheritance. Explicit empty library and permission arrays,
`false`, and zero concurrency limits retain their distinct meanings. Account
identity and ordinary boolean fields reject null.

`POST /api/v2/admin/users` returns 201 with `{ "id": "..." }` and `Location`.
Default-profile creation, when requested, uses the existing transactional
provisioner. Unsupported transactional profile storage fails before account
creation. Username/email conflicts return 409.

Account listing accepts `GET /api/v2/admin/users?identity=...` for an exact,
case-insensitive match against either username or email. Surrounding whitespace
is trimmed; partial matches, wildcard expansion and mailbox-provider aliases
are not applied. Matching runs in the database before pagination and includes
disabled and administrator accounts. Omit the filter to retain the full listing.
The continuation cursor binds the filter and acting account; changing either
requires starting a new listing. Account capabilities advertise
`exact_identity_filter`. Existing `admin:users` keys may use this read.

An identity lookup does not reserve an identity or authorize a change. Conditional
account updates and database uniqueness remain authoritative at write time.

`POST /api/v2/admin/users/{id}/impersonate` returns the shared token-pair contract.
It creates a login session and has no replay identity. Clients must not retry an
uncertain response automatically. The web client checks its captured authority
before installing returned credentials.

## Access groups

`/api/v2/admin/access-groups` supports bounded list and create operations; the
`/{id}` resource supports canonical GET, guarded PUT, and guarded DELETE. Create
returns 201 and Location. Update returns the new canonical representation and
ETag; delete returns 204. Missing/stale guards return 428/412.

Group configuration changes advance a monotonic revision, including default-group
changes. Canonical editor responses exclude changing membership counts; list
responses include them. Group changes and account policy propagation share the
same transaction and lock order. Group and account writes have no automatic
response replay; after an uncertain result, reload before starting another intent.

## Account projections

| Route below `/api/v2/admin` | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /users/{id}/profiles` | Complete profile collection with string IDs and names |
| `GET /users/{id}/api-keys` | Bounded metadata-only key collection; no stored credential |
| `GET /users/{id}/ips` | Bounded IP history for one account |
| `GET /ips?ip=...` | Bounded account history for one valid IP address |
| `GET /users/{id}/settings/values` | Bounded setting-value collection and contract revision |
| `PUT /users/{id}/settings/values/{key}` | Validated setting value |
| `DELETE /users/{id}/settings/values/{key}` | 204 |

Paginated reads accept `limit` (up to 200) and signed `cursor`; responses expose
`items` and `page`. Cursors bind the actor/profile, target, filters, and page size.
IP queries accept `days` from 1 to 365, defaulting to 30. Their cursor preserves a
fixed observation window and deterministic last-seen ties. Newer events do not
move earlier groups across that cursor. Addresses are returned without CIDR masks.

Administrator settings use explicit target identity query parameters: `scope`,
`profile_id`, `client_family`, `device_id`, `library_id`, and `series_id` as required
by the setting scope. They never substitute the acting administrator's profile.
Both PostgreSQL and SQLite paginate by the full setting identity. Writes reuse
existing validation, normalization, mirror updates, and last-write semantics;
see [settings API](settings-api.md). Reset `nav.shortcuts` with PUT of its empty
document; DELETE is rejected. The web bulk-reset flow reports partial completion.

These administrator projections do not alter Jellyfin compatibility contracts.
There are no corresponding first-party Apple or Android API callers.
