// Package apiv2 embeds the committed API v2 contract artifacts so every
// consumer reads the exact bytes that were checked in: the
// internal/contractledger gate, internal/routeinventory, internal/scenariocatalog,

// internal/apiv2.

// This package deliberately contains nothing but the embed directives; loading
// and validation live in the packages above.
