# apiv2-ledger

Tooling behind the consumer evidence in `contracts/api/v2/migration.json`. See
"Migration ledger" in `docs/architecture/api-contract.md` for how the pieces fit.
Commands assume the repository root is the cwd and take repository paths as
arguments; export the sibling repos with `git archive <sha>` at the commit you
will pin rather than pointing the scripts at a working checkout.

- `extract_consumers.py WEB_SRC APPLE_ROOT ANDROID_ROOT OUT` — find every
  first-party HTTP/WebSocket call site against the native API, including paths
  built by helper functions and string builders.
- `match_consumers.py ROUTE_INVENTORY CALL_SITES OUT_MAP OUT_UNMATCHED` — map
  call sites onto inventory rows by normalized path template and method; the
  unmatched list is for manual resolution.
- `sweep_uncredited.py ROUTE_INVENTORY LEDGER WEB_SRC APPLE_ROOT ANDROID_ROOT [APPLE_GIT ANDROID_GIT]`
  — grep the last two static segments of every inventory path and list every
  request-shaped hit the ledger does not credit yet; with the sibling git
  checkouts given, also report credited files missing at the pinned commits
  as `stale-against-pinned-tree`.
- `build_ledger.py ROUTE_INVENTORY CONSUMER_MAP LEDGER APPLE_SHA ANDROID_SHA`
- `assign_sections.py [--check] [LEDGER]` writes the `section` field (the Phase 4 delivery
  unit) onto every entry from listener, namespace and path; `--check` is what
  `make verify-migration-ledger` runs. Move a route between sections by editing the
  script's tables, then rerun it.
  — merge a regenerated inventory and consumer map into the ledger by key,
  preserving curated fields, manual and follower call sites, and each
  mechanical site's `path_literal_line`; seeds defaults only for rows with no
  entry. The two SHAs (`git rev-parse origin/main` in each sibling after
  `git fetch`) are written to the ledger's `source_trees` header and must be
  the commits the trees were exported from. Re-running on an unchanged
  inventory and consumer map rewrites the ledger byte for byte. The optional
  curated field `concurrency` (`if_match`: the row's v2 operation is
  registered Guarded and requires `If-Match`) is preserved on rows that carry
  it and never seeded; `internal/contractledger` restricts it to tier-1 ported
  mutation rows and reconciles the set against the v2 registry. The curated
  fields `retry_safety` and `retry_safety_note` are preserved the same way.
  `retry_safety` is required on every tier-1 ported row with a mutating method
  (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and every ported mutation mapped to `v2.operation_id`.
  Ported tier-2 mutations may carry it before mapping; unimplemented tier-2 rows need no
  classification. Reads and non-ported rows cannot carry it. It records the
  strategy from the contract's "Mutation retry safety" section that makes a
  duplicate submission or a retry after a lost response safe. The v2 registry
  declares the same value as `x-silo-retry-safety` and
  `internal/contractledger` reconciles the two. `retry_safety_note` (at most
  300 characters) explains a non-obvious choice and is required for
  `idempotency_key` and `non_retryable`.

  | `retry_safety`       | Meaning                                                                        |
  | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `natural_idempotent` | Repeating the same request converges without duplicate durable state or side effects, regardless of HTTP method.      |
  | `unique_constraint`  | Natural key or client-supplied id enforced by a database uniqueness constraint. |
  | `domain_identity`    | Durable domain operation id (playback attempt, upload, job, webhook delivery). |
  | `coalescing`         | Returns the already-active scan, refresh, sync or similar job.                 |
  | `durable_dispatch`   | State-gated or transactional-outbox dispatch of an external side effect.       |
  | `idempotency_key`    | Generic key; the note names the residual group that justified it.              |
  | `non_retryable`      | Documented exception; clients never auto-retry after an uncertain response.    |

Two call-site annotations refine what the pinned-tree test
(`TestSiblingCallSitesResolveAgainstPinnedTrees` in `internal/contractledger`)
checks at a sibling site. `path_literal_line` is the line where a path
constant is declared when the call line only names it (`static let endpoint`,
`const val DEVICES_PATH`), so the route's last static segment is looked for
there instead of at `line`. `match: follower` marks a site that never spells
the path because the client fetches a server-supplied URL from the playback
plan, and the site is the validator or resolver that admits it; a follower is
exempt from the segment check but its file and line must still exist at the
pin. The test skips only when a sibling checkout is absent next to this
repository; a checkout that is present but has not fetched the pinned commit,
or a site that no longer holds up at the pin, fails it.
