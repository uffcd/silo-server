/**
 * The one place playback.auto_play_next is read and written.
 *
 * Two surfaces edit this setting — the Playback settings screen and the
 * post-roll "Auto-play is on/off" toggle — and both render the *resolved*
 * value. The contract resolves profile_device above profile, so a surface that
 * writes the device row while the other writes the profile row makes the
 * second control inert: it saves a profile value the device row keeps
 * shadowing, and the switch snaps back on the next read. Sharing one hook is
 * what stops the two disagreeing about which scope a save lands at.
 *
 * The chosen scope is the profile, matching the rest of the Playback screen:
 * "auto-play the next episode" is a viewing preference, not a property of the
 * browser it was expressed in. A device row can still exist — the settings
 * migration converts legacy user_device_settings rows into profile_device
 * ones, and the contract lets other clients write it — so a save clears this
 * device's row as well. Without that, a migrated override would silently
 * shadow every later choice with no web affordance to remove it.
