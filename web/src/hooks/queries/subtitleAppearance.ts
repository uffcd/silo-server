 * The one place subtitle appearance is read and written.

 * The value used to live behind three bespoke endpoints
 * (/settings/subtitle_appearance/effective and the PUT/DELETE pair on
 * /settings/device/subtitle_appearance) that existed only because the legacy
 * string API had no way to express "this device's copy of an object-valued
 * setting". The contract does: playback.subtitle_appearance is an object typed
 * by the manifest, resolving profile_device → profile → default, so a device
 * override is an ordinary write at profile_device and "use the fallback" is an
 * ordinary delete at that scope.
 *
 * Three surfaces render this value — the settings screen, the in-player panel,
 * and the cue renderer — and before the cutover each parsed the effective
 * response itself. Sharing one hook is what keeps them from disagreeing about
 * which scope a save lands at.
