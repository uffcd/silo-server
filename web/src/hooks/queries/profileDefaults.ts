/**
 * Writing a profile default when a device override may be shadowing it.
 *
 * Every "Defaults" screen reads the *resolved* value and writes the profile
 * row. The contract resolves profile_device above profile, so if a device row
 * exists — the settings migration converts legacy user_device_settings rows
 * into profile_device ones, and other clients write them directly — the
 * profile write lands but the displayed value never moves: the override keeps
 * winning and the control snaps back. Clearing this device's row alongside the
 * profile write is what makes the control mean what it says, and is the only
 * affordance the web has for removing a migrated override.
 *
 * useAutoPlayNextSetting arrived at this shape first, for the same reason;
 * this is that logic with the key as a parameter.
