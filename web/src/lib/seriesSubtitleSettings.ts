 * The canonical settings an in-player subtitle pick stores for a series.
 *
 * Two surfaces have to agree on this list. The player writes these rows when
 * the viewer picks a track (WatchPage), and "Auto" on the item page clears
 * them (useDeleteSubtitlePreference) — profile_series is the first scope in
 * the manifest's resolution order for both keys, so a row this list forgets is
 * a row that outranks every later choice with nothing in the UI able to remove
 * it. Adding a key here wires up both halves at once.
 *
 * playback.show_forced_subtitles is deliberately absent. The player has no
 * forced-subtitle control: the value it holds is the *resolved* one, which for
 * a viewer who never expressed a preference is the contract default. Writing
 * it back would pin that default at the top of the ladder and permanently
 * shadow the profile-scope toggle on the Subtitles settings screen. It stays
 * on the legacy composite row, which is not part of the canonical ladder.
